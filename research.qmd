I work as PI of the project "The social mechanisms behind the economic consequences of physical appearance, SOMA" funded by the Academy of Finland (2019-2023). During 2016-2018 I led research project “Finland as an appearance society” funded by Emil Aaltonen foundation. I'm also part of the consumption reference budget research team at the University of Turku.

Currently, I am working on the book "Handbook of Beauty and Inequality" together with my colleague Professor Giselinde Kuipers (KU Leuven). The book is scheduled to be published in 2024.
